Carpenter's Blocks
================

This is a Minecraft Forge mod that adds slopes and a variety of vanilla inspired blocks that support covers, side covers, overlays, dyes and chiseled patterns.

================

This branch is built against Forge 14.23.0.2491 for Minecraft 1.12.2 and is experimental.  Blocks and items may be missing, crashes will be frequent and server compatiblity is not tested.  Please feel free to submit pull requests if you would like to help put the mod back together for Minecraft 1.10.2 and beyond!
